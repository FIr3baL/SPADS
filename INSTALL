To install SPADS on Linux/UNIX, you have to:
============================================

1) Ensure Perl, swig and g++ are installed and available in your PATH (all standard Perl core modules must be available, on some systems such as RedHat/Fedora/CentOS this requires installing a metapackage usually named "perl-core")
2) Run "./spadsInstaller.pl" (SPADS will be installed in current directory)
3) Check your configuration files, in particular "spads.conf", "hostingPresets.conf" and "battlePresets.conf"

Then you can run SPADS as follows:
"./spads.pl <spadsConfPath>" (for instance: "./spads.pl etc/spads.conf")

3) Open a Command shell, go in the directory where you extracted SPADS installation files, and run "perl spadsInstaller.pl" (SPADS will be installed in current directory)
4) Check your configuration files, in particular "spads.conf", "hostingPresets.conf" and "battlePresets.conf"

Then you can run SPADS as follows:
"perl spads.pl <spadsConfPath>" (for instance: "perl spads.pl etc/spads.conf")
