This plugin makes SPADS auto-reloads its configuration when it receives a
configurable POSIX signal (one of "USR1", "USR2" and "HUP"). The USR1 signal is
used by default. SPADS configuration is reloaded in "keepSettings" mode:
current settings values are kept as they are to not disrupt active battle
rooms (configuration reload is transparent for users). Only the lists of
allowed values are updated, as well as all other configuration structures (ban
lists, map lists, map boxes etc.)
